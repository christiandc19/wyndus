                <p>A common but serious mood disorder, depression can affect oneâ€™s overall behavior, sleep, eating, or ability to perform day-to-day tasks and obligations. There are several types of depression, but the most commonly diagnosed is Major Depressive Disorder (or Clinical Depression).
