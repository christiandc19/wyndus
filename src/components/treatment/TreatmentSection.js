          Mental Health and Substance Abuse Treatment Above and Beyond the Norms
        </h1>
        <p>
          Here at Rodeo Recovery, we firmly stand that without addressing
          our physical aspect, the mind cannot successfully recover. We go above
          and beyond the norms of mental health care, through a thorough and
          intentional treatment plan that is specific to every kind of
          individual that addresses not only the mental but also the physical
          inequalities in the body.
          <br />
          <br />
          Methods used by Rodeo Recovery are non-invasive, distinct, and
          successful in relieving acute symptoms that act as roadblocks to
          receiving the full therapy. Additionally, to get past more difficult
          progress barriers, these services are provided on a consistent and
          ongoing basis which is closely observed in coordination with our
          clinical team.
          <br />
          <br />
          The physical, mental, and spiritual imbalances have been found to be
          restored by its healing methods. Our design of mental health treatment
          is custom-fit to every individual. Compared to the programs which are
          commonly used, we are a firm believer that we can reach the full
          potential of our well-being by healing the body, mind and spirit.
