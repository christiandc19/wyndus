                <p>Xanax is officially classified as a benzodiazepine, a drug used to treat disorders such as anxiety or panic disorders. Like other prescriptions, they are meant for short-term usage, and due to their potency and relieving qualities, addiction can quickly set in.<br/> <br/>
                Also referred to as ‘bars’ ‘Xannies’, and ‘ladders’, Xanax is a prescription drug, but often misused.<br/><br/>
                Although not intended for pain relief, Xanax is relatable to opioids in terms of the user experiencing euphoria and the flushing out of negative feelings or emotions. These experiences/effects alone can lead to an easy path of addiction. It is also commonly abused in combination with substances like alcohol or opioids.<br/><br/>
                When taken in high doses, Xanax can lead to serious side effects, ranging from coma, to respiratory arrest, and even death.
