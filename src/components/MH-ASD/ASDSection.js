                <p>Acute Stress Disorder (ASD) is your brainâ€™s reaction to a traumatic event. Trauma can be direct or indirect. That is, the trauma that causes disorders like ASD can either be a direct, first-hand experience (ex. violence, harm, and sexual assault), or through indirect involvement in a traumatic event, for example, learning about the abrupt passing of a loved one. Acute Stress Disorder affects not just the individual, but also those nearest and dearest to them. If left untreated for an extended time, ASD can cause further development of other disorders.
